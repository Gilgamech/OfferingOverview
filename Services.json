This is necessary to separate the VM from the physical asset, to move either the VM or asset (or its data) to another physical host, or replace the physical device with a virtualized replacement. Any full OS reboot from the AWS console will satisfy this requirement, and there is a notification in the Personal Health Dashboard that will clear once the requirement is satisfied.
