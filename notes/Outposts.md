# Outposts

## Rent servers or full server racks from AWS, running AWS APIs in your physical data center.

**Notes**:

- Has 2 flavors: Servers and Racks.
- Servers: An industry-standard 1U or 2U server, which can be installed in a standard EIA-310D 19-inch compliant 4-post rack.
- Racks: An industry-standard 42U rack, including rack-mountable servers, switches, a network patch panel, a power shelf and blank panels.
- The AWS Console still says 'Outposts server orders will begin shipping in the second quarter of 2022' so hopefully they did.
- Pricing varies slightly per country.
- Requires a 3 year commitment.
