# EKS

## Elastic Kubernetes Service

**Paid Tier**: $0.10 per hour per cluster.
**Ownership**: Amazon
**Type**: SaaS
**Segment**: Container orchestration
**Notes**:

- EKS on Fargate only costs the compute resources used.
- EKS on Outposts - the EKS still runs in AWS, so still costs $0.10 per hour per cluster. The Outposts EC2 instances involved run free of charge.
- Istio extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network using the powerful Envoy service proxy. Working with both Kubernetes and traditional workloads, Istio brings standard, universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments.
- Tetrate is an AWS Partner that was started by Istio and Envoy founders and maintainers to reimagine application networking, and part of the nuts and bolts of that mission is operationalizing service mesh configuration, deployment, and management.
